    <h3>Ingredients (not everything)</h3>
    <div class="ingredients"><ul>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pound ground beef chuck
        </li>
        <li>
           3 ounces tomato paste(half a 6-ounce can) 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano
        </li>
    </ul></div>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To begin, prepare the sauce by combining tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and other ingredients. The sauce has a rich depth of flavor thanks to the three varieties of tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While you boil the noodles and prepare the cheeses, let this simmer. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan; this three-cheese mixture provides the lasagna wonderful flavor, much like the combination of tomatoes!
        </li>
        <li>
            It's merely an assembly job after that.
            A layer of noodles, a cup of beef sauce, additional noodles, sauce, and cheese.
            Repeat this process until you have three layers and all of the components are gone. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until it is bubbly then you're done! It's ready to be enjoyed!
        </li>
