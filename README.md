# odin-recipes
This is a T.O.P (The Odin Project) project where a simple recipe website will be made. This will show the beginner level of HTML I am able to demonstrate.

This recipe page was made with the Odin Project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes 
With this I learned how to better write HMTL, add a bit of CSS styling, use Git as well as Github, pushing to a remote repository.
